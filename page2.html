        <h2>Why Software Engineering?</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="why">
        <p>The first time I knew I was passionate about coding was editing a mod for one of my favorite video games, Stardew Valley. I found two mods that changed the appearances of coop and barn animals. At the time I knew nothing about code. I just knew that when I launched my game, the animals were only using one mod. Logically, I figured out that it is probably because you can't code the same object. So, I went into the code of one and removed the animals that I didn't like the look of, but kept those animals in the other mod, in which I adored the graphics. 
        Going through that code not only made me feel really happy when I figured it on my own, but excited to face future challenges like it. Now as I've gained more experience, I know that I hope to play some part in web design or coding for video games. I like that software engineering is always a job in demand, and especially for a woman. Furthermore, I want to travel the world and working remote is a high possibility when it comes to this field.
